    <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> My Inspiration is Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Adebayo Akinfenwa. I like Ronaldo Nazário because when playing on the soccer field, he was aggressive, determined, and strong. I like Cristiano Ronaldo becauae he is a superb soccer player and when he was a kid, he faced through a lot of difficulties and never gave up. I like Adebayo Akinfenwa because of the same thing, he went through more difficulties than Cristiano Ronaldo did. Some soccer clubs didn't want him because of his color. Also, the fans were very rude to him as well but, he didn't give up. </p>
